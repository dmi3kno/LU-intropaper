### Anseriformes, Family Anatidae
- 146 species in 43 genera. Prized quarry for hunters &lt;a name=cite-kear2005DucksGeeseSwans&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Kear and Hulme, 2005](#bib-kear2005DucksGeeseSwans))

- Mostly unregulated hunting up until early XX century. Loss of habitat and overdepletion as a result

- Hunting regulation and creation of wildlife refuges turned the trend around for most species

- Today waterfowl management is arguably a hallmark of success in environmental resource management &lt;a name=cite-nichols1995ManagingNorthAmerican&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Nichols, Johnson, and Williams, 1995](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2097204))

# Risk and uncertainty

---
# Glossary

&lt;a name=cite-knight1921RiskUncertaintyProfit&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[Knight (1921)](#bib-knight1921RiskUncertaintyProfit) proposed the following definitions of "risk" and "uncertainty":
.pull-left[
#### Risk
- Outcome is not known, but the frequency distribution from which an outcome of interest is drawn ("source distribution") is well understood. It is possible to know how likely each outcome is to appear &lt;a name=cite-morgan1990UncertaintyGuideDealing&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Morgan, Henrion, and Small, 1990](#bib-morgan1990UncertaintyGuideDealing))
- It is, therefore, appropriate for the "plausibility reasoning robot" &lt;a name=cite-jaynes2003ProbabilityTheoryLogic&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Jaynes, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423)) to characterize the uncertainty in a randomly picked (sampled) outcome by a probability distribution with the same parameters as the known frequency distribution.
- Such uncertainty is called "aleatory", from Latin - *alea* - dice &lt;a name=cite-fox2011DistinguishingTwoDimensions&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Fox and Ülkümen, 2011](#bib-fox2011DistinguishingTwoDimensions))
- Can not be reduced, only "resolved".
]

--

.pull-right[
####Uncertainty
- "Source distribution" is unknown
- The lack-of-knowledge about such source frequency distribution is called "epistemic" uncertainty from Greek - *episteme* - knowledge.
- Expressed with probability, indicating "degree of belief" &lt;a name=cite-ohagan2004DicingUnknown&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([O'Hagan, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2004.00050.x)) or "plausibility" ([Jaynes, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423)). The probability is personal, but not arbitrary, because it is consistent with probability axioms and "plausibility reasoning desiderata" ([Morgan, Henrion, and Small, 1990](#bib-morgan1990UncertaintyGuideDealing); [Jaynes, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423))
- Can be, in principle, reduced through exploration, experimentation and knowledge acquisition &lt;a name=cite-kleindorfer2010ReflectionsDecisionMaking&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Kleindorfer, 2010](#bib-kleindorfer2010ReflectionsDecisionMaking))
]

# Epistemic uncertainty

- Bayesian Analysis
    - reason about the “source distribution” based on samples. 
    - infer parameters, while the "likelihood" is fixed, but the two are inseparable &lt;a name=cite-gelman2017PriorCanGenerally&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Gelman, Simpson, and Betancourt, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07487))
    - model uncertainty can, sometimes, be converted into parameter uncertainty ([Morgan, Henrion, and Small, 1990](#bib-morgan1990UncertaintyGuideDealing))

--

- Model uncertainty
    - Not only about the choice of probability distribution, but also about the functional form or alternative theory, aka "structural uncertainty" &lt;a name=cite-bojke2009CharacterizingStructuralUncertainty&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Bojke, Claxton, Sculpher, and Palmer, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00502.x))
    - Can not assign probabilities, only weights reflecting relative plausibility &lt;a name=cite-cox2012ConfrontingDeepUncertainties&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Cox, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01792.x))

--

- Ontological uncertainty
   - Future changes in 
       - beliefs(models), 
       - values(objectives) and 
       - available choices (alternatives) &lt;a name=cite-derbyshire2019AnswersQuestionsUncertainty&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Derbyshire, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X19877885))
   - Requires non-probabilistic scenario-based methods

# Epistemology in science
.pull-left[ 
###Rationalism

- Can be traced back to XVII century philosophers, including Spinoza, Leibniz and Kant.

- Descartes: deductive reconstruction of knowledge starting from *cogito, ergo sum*

- Senses are untrustworthy, logical reasoning can provide unquestionable truth about the world. 

- Tearing down the world to reconstruct it

- Ultimate question: "Is it so?"
]

--
.pull-right[
###Pragmatism

- Originated in late XIX century in the East Coast USA (Harvard, Johns Hopkins University)

- Pierce and Dewey: Uncertainty is deliberation on "what to do", conditioned and directed by the goals and alternatives considered. These determine what is perceived as "relevant".

- Otto Neurath: "Search for truth ~ repairing a ship in high seas". Limited realism.

- Ultimate question: "Will it work"?

# Decision analysis

A discipline at the crossroads of statistics, normative decision science, behavioral psychology and organization theory. First proposed by Ronald A. Howard, supported by Howard Raiffa.  Most often associated with Operations Research.
.pull-left[
#### Main components
- Subjectivist interpretation of probability (Bernoulli, Laplace)

- Decision-theoretic view of probability and utility (Keynes, Ramsey, de Finetti, Savage)

- Acknowledging and accounting for decision biases (Kahneman &amp; Tversky)

- Prescriptive ("engineering") approach to decision structuring (Howard, Raiffa)

#### “Modeling” approach to DA
- Decision model as a product. “Extra-personal representation” of the problem.
- The objective is not "the right answer", but the "clarity of action".

# Values in DA.

- Weber, Kuhn: Value-free ideal = "epistemic values only" &lt;a name=cite-douglas2015ValuesScience&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Douglas, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.28))

- Non-epistemic values allowed only in "external aspects" 

![Values diagram](index_files/figure-html/dot-values-diagram-1.png)

.pull-right[
- Pragmatists: values are inseparable from scientific inquiry and need to be embraced and examined

- Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA): systematically eliciting inputs from various stakeholders, using models to combine them with the aim of ranking alternatives.

- Criticism of decision analysis: assumes decision maker is aware of her own values (see non-bayesian decision theory &lt;a name=cite-peterson2008NonbayesianDecisionTheory&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Peterson, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8699-1))). But the aim is not to provide "the right answer", but to usher the "clarity of action".

- Difficulty to trade-off is not the same as difficulty to enumerate values.

# Modeling of decision making

Most decisions in environmental management are recurring. Markov Decision Process (MDP) is mathematical model for sequential decision making in stochastic environments &lt;a name=cite-puterman1994MarkovDecisionProcesses&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Puterman, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470316887)).

#### Basic idea:

- agent is placed within stochastic environment, which changes in response to his actions
    
- the state of the environment affect agent's rewards and the future states the environment can transition into

#### Objective:

- select a sequence of actions that will maximize long-term reward

- embedded trade-off: receive utility now or improve chances of obtaining utility in the future 

#### Variations:

- with regards to uncertainty: known parameters vs. MDP under uncertainty

- based on process observability: fully observable vs. partially observable MDP (POMDP)

- Complex environmental models aiming to capture every detail

#### DT school
- focuses on defining the problem, clarifying objectives and developing management alternatives prior to building process models &lt;a name=cite-johnson1999ProtocolPracticeAdaptive&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Johnson and Williams, 1999](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-00091-030108)).

# Adaptive Management and VOI

- Value of Information (VOI) is "potential management value that is foregone under uncertainty" &lt;a name=cite-williams2011AdaptiveResourceManagement&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Williams, Eaton, and Breininger, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.07.003)). Without the information *a different management action* is
preferred. If the the wrong action is taken, the expected performance will be lower and therefore, decision maker will suffer an “opportunity loss” &lt;a name=cite-raiffa1970DecisionAnalysisIntroductory&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Raiffa, 1970](#bib-raiffa1970DecisionAnalysisIntroductory)). 

- In its simplest form VOI is a difference between value with and without the information. Difference in value originates from changed course of action.

- Can guide allocation of resources towards areas with the highest impact on the choice of management actions &lt;a name=cite-runge2011WhichUncertaintyUsing&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Runge, Converse, and Lyons, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.12.020))

- Gradual adaptation balances *learning* and *management* &lt;a name=cite-moore2017TwostepAdaptiveManagement&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Moore, Walker, Runge, McDonald‐Madden, and McCarthy, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1515)) ("dual-control problem")

- Results of the VOI analysis are conditional upon the context of the decision
(decision frame), choice of the value metric (objectives), and the set of management actions it considers. Other factors affecting the result are choice (and structure) of model and specific parametrization 

Classic DA books discuss VOPI (Value of Perfect Information), which forms "upper limit" for VOI. In practice information is always imperfect, so Expected Value of Partial Information &lt;a name=cite-williams2015ValueInformationNatural&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Williams and Johnson, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1363)) and Expected Value of Sample Information ([Runge, Converse, and Lyons, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.12.020)) is used.

Improvement of habitats is one of the key objectives of EU Bird Directive &lt;a name=cite-europeanparliament2010Directive2009147&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2010](http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/147/oj)). Explicit (mechanistic) models can fit the data more accurately and provide prediction outside of training range &lt;a name=cite-baveco2017CombiningModellingTools&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Nichols, Johnson, and Williams, 1995](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2097204); [Baveco, Bergjord, Bjerke, Chudzińska, Pellissier, Simonsen, Madsen, Tombre, and Nolet, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0899-5)).

#### ABM
- Traditionally addressed with Ordinary Differential Equations

- Lowered cost and accessibility of computation made agent-based models (ABMs) feasible

- ABMs are simulation tools for studying populations &lt;a name=cite-grimm2005IndividualbasedModelingEcology&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Grimm and Railsback, 2005](#bib-grimm2005IndividualbasedModelingEcology))

- Explicit accounting for interaction between agents and their environments

# Human dimensions

Waterfowl management policy should to be considered in the integrated social-ecological context,
incorporating stakeholder objectives and incentives &lt;a name=cite-madsen2015GuidelinesSustainableHarvest&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=cite-johnson2015TrainingConservationPractitioners&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Madsen, Bunnefeld, Nagy, Griffin, du
Rau, Mondain-Monval, Hearn, Grauer, Merkel, Williams, and others, 2015](#bib-madsen2015GuidelinesSustainableHarvest); [Johnson, Eaton, Williams, Jensen, and Madsen, 2015](https://doi.org/10.3390/su7078354)).

- Perspectives of different stakeholder might vary (citizens vs hunters vs authorities vs farmers). Within human-nature conflict there's usually human-human conflict embedded.

- Difficulties of governing. Change of management objectives at the pressure of stakeholders. Case of mid-Norway geese management &lt;a name=cite-eythorsson2017GooseManagementSchemes&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Eythórsson, Tombre, and Madsen, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-016-0884-4))

- Need for multi-agent, multi-objective (behavioral) coupled simulation &lt;a name=cite-liu2007ComplexityCoupledHuman&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Liu, Dietz, Carpenter, Alberti, Folke, Moran, Pell, Deadman, Kratz, Lubchenco, Ostrom, Ouyang, Provencher, Redman, Schneider, and Taylor, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1144004))

#### Question: Should scientists model stakeholder objectives explicitly given that they affect success of management actions implementation?

# Key takeaways

.pull-left[
- Environmental decisions require structured approach. 

- Decision Analysis offers prescriptive approach to improving decision making. Principles, process and methods embracing uncertainty, objectives and decision alternatives.

- MCDA-based Adaptive Management approach for iterative decision making is successfully adopted in waterfowl management in North America and in Europe.

- Model-based decision analysis utilizes various statistical and simulation models for modeling of systems, environments and agents aiming to provide clarity of action for decision makers.
