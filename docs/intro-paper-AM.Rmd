# Why Decision Analysis?

---
# Scientific Epistemology
.pull-left[ 
###Rationalism

- Can be traced back to XVII century philosophers, including Spinoza, Leibniz and Kant.

- Descartes: deductive reconstruction of knowledge starting from *cogito, ergo sum*

- Senses are untrustworthy, logical reasoning can provide unquestionable truth about the world. Tearing down the world to reconstruct it

- Ultimate test: "Is it so?"
]

--
.pull-right[
###Pragmatism

- Originated in late XIX century in the East Coast USA (Harvard, Johns Hopkins University)

- Pierce and Dewey: Uncertainty is deliberation on "what to do", conditioned and directed by the goals and alternatives considered. These determine what is perceived as "relevant".

- Otto Neurath: "Search for truth ~ repairing a ship in high seas". Limited realism.

- Ultimate test: "Will it work"?

# Decision analysis

A discipline at the crossroads of statistics, normative decision science, behavioral psychology and organization theory. Most often associated with Operations Research.
.pull-left[
#### Main components
- Subjectivist interpretation of probability (Bernoulli, Laplace)

- Decision theoretic view of probability and utility (Keynes, Ramsey, de Finetti, Savage)

- Prescriptive ("engineering") approach to decision structuring (Howard, Raiffa)
]
--
.pull-right[
#### Structured Decision Making (PrOACT)
1. *Pr*oblem - framing the decision context
2. *O*bjectives - aims and metrics
3. *A*lternatives - actions to achieve objectives
4. *C*onsequences - characterized outcomes
5. *T*rade-offs - between objectives in terms of metrics

]

--

#### “Modeling” approach to DA: 
- Linking alternatives and outcomes through information gathered from a DM or his delegates.
- Decision model as a product. “Extra-personal representation” of the problem.
- Objective is not "the right answer", but the "clarity of action".

# Values in DA. VOI

.pull-left[
- Weber, Kuhn: Value-free ideal = "epistemic values only" `r Citep(ip_bib, "douglas2015ValuesScience")`

- Non-epistemic values allowed only in "external aspects" 

```{r dot-values-diagram, engine = "dot", fig.cap = "Values diagram", cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
digraph test123 {

  e->e_fn[headlabel="false\nnegative", labelangle=270, labeldistance=3, fontname="times italic"];
}
```
 - Pragmatists: values are inseparable from scientific inquity and need to be embraced and examined
`r Citep(ip_bib, "stuhr2003PragmatismValuesValuable")`
]
--
.pull-right[
- Value of Information (VOI) is "potential management value that is foregone under uncertainty" `r Citep(ip_bib, "williams2011AdaptiveResourceManagement")`

- Results of the VOI analysis are conditional upon the context of the decision
(decision frame), choice of the value metric (objectives), and the set of management actions it considers. Other factors affecting the result are choice (and structure) of model and specific parametrization `r Citep(ip_bib, "runge2011WhichUncertaintyUsing")`

- In its simplest form VOI is a difference between value with and without the information. Difference in value originates from changed course of action.

`r Citet(ip_bib, "rist2013AdaptiveManagementWhere")` literature review:

- AM is misunderstood and misinterpreted

- Often AM is confused for "trial and error" approach.

- Far from original meaning in `r Citet(ip_bib, "holling1978AdaptiveEnvironmentalAssessment")`: "proactive experimentation as a method of learning".

# Waterfowl management worldwide

## USA
- North American Waterfowl Management Plan is a hallmark of success. 
- Population monitoring programs, flyway-scale wildlife research and management working groups 
- State-of-the-art population models and advising harvest regulation across the continent

## Europe
- African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) drafted in 1999 is today ratified by 80 countries. Backed up by EU Bird Directive (2009/147/EC).
- European Goose Management Platform (2016) initiated species-focused working groups for developing ISMP (International Species Management Plans) for *pink-footed goose* and *taiga bean goose* (with *barnacle goose* and *greylag goose*) in the working.
- Experience transfer from North America with Fred A. Johnson (US. Geological Survey) advising the EGM IWG.

3 steps taken on annual basis `r Citep(ip_bib, "johnson2000AdaptiveRegulationWaterfowl")`:

1. Identify optimal regulatory action, based on the knowledge about the state of the system (e.g. population characteristics) and the weights of the alternative models
2. Given the optimal regulatory action, determine model-specific projections of population size
3. When next year's monitoring data is available, adjust model weights according to individual model's ability to predict the change in population
